## Repositories to note

[exercises](https://github.com/benj-chen/exercises) contains the bulk of my CS projects and challenges, like USACO solutions, Advent of Code, and Codeforces, along with less active problem sources like cses.fi. Live USACO solutions are put in their separate directory within their level.

There used to be a repository called tictactoe, which was my way of demonstrating my ttt algorithm, file importing, etc. However, I used my tictactoe code in an AP Computer Science Principles exam, which does not want it to be posted publicly. It's now private, but important aspects like the code and timestamps are still just fine. It will reappear in August, even though the exam is in June, just to be safe!
