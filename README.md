### Benjamin Chen

Languages:

Python

C++11/C++14/C++17

Java (to a lesser degree, but I could catch up)

## Repositories to note

[exercises](https://github.com/benj-chen/exercises) contains the bulk of my CS projects and challenges, like USACO solutions, Advent of Code, and Codeforces, along with less active problem sources like cses.fi. Live USACO solutions are put in their separate directory within their level.

There used to be a repository called tictactoe, which was my way of demonstrating my ttt algorithm, file importing, etc. However, I used my tictactoe code in an AP Computer Science Principles exam, which does not want it to be posted publicly. It's now private, but important aspects like the code and timestamps are still just fine. It will reappear in August, even though the exam is in June, just to be safe!

Due to my timezone (UTC-7), I can't attend live contests from most places, such as Codeforces (MSK, UTC+3) and Codechef (IST, UTC+5:30), both about 15 hours or so ahead of me. As such, competitions often start in the very early morning hours, too early for me to wake up.

password-gen is a recent project that I made that creates a password out of random syllables. You can specify the length too. An example: for input 10, it may output one or two passwords: two if the syllables put together goes over the length, in which it will also display a password under, or one password with the exact length:
(input 10)
length 11:
tofffacklod
(toff-fack-lod)
or length 8:
tofffack
(toff-fack)

You should use this for password security! It's certainly better than the random characters and strings that Google or Apple makes for you.
