## Repositories to note

[exercises](https://github.com/benj-chen/exercises) contains the bulk of my competitive programming solutions to USACO, Advent of Code, and Codeforces, mostly from high school.

[password_gen](https://github.com/benj-chen/password_gen) creates a password out of random syllables so as to make it pronounceable. I had this idea of pronounceable pseudorandom password generation many years before it was included in modern password services. An example: for input 10, it may output one or two passwords: two if the syllables put together goes over the length, in which it will also display a password under, or one password with the exact length:

(input 10)

length 11:

tofffacklod

(toff-fack-lod)

or length 8:

tofffack

(toff-fack)
